<body class="x-ebookmaker"><p>This from Barthes bewildered me in my conjectures. I had always suspected M. de Choisuel to be the secret author of all the persecutions I suffered in Switzerland. The conduct of the resident of Geneva, and that of the ambassador at Soleure but too much confirmed my suspicion; I perceived the secret influence of France in everything that happened to me at Berne, Geneva and Neuchatel, and I did not think I had any powerful enemy in that kingdom, except the Duke de Choiseul. What therefore could I think of the visit of Barthes and the tender concern he showed for my welfare? My misfortunes had not yet destroyed the confidence natural to my heart, and I had still to learn from experience to discern snares under the appearance of friendship. I sought with surprise the reason of the benevolence of M. Barthes; I was not weak enough to believe he had acted from himself; there was in his manner something ostentatious, an affectation even which declared a concealed intention, and I was far from having found in any of these little subaltern agents, that generous intrepidity which, when I was in a similar employment, had often caused a fermentation in my heart. I had formerly known something of the Chevalier Beauteville, at the castle of Montmorency; he had shown me marks of esteem; since his appointment to the embassy he had given me proofs of his not having entirely forgotten me, accompanied with an invitation to go and see him at Soleure. Though I did not accept this invitation, I was extremely sensible of his civility, not having been accustomed to be treated with such kindness by people in place. I presume M. de Beauteville, obliged to follow his instructions in what related to the affairs of Geneva, yet pitying me under my misfortunes, had by his private cares prepared for me the asylum of Bienne, that I might live there in peace under his auspices. I was properly sensible of his attention, but without wishing to profit by it and quite determined upon the journey to Berlin, I sighed after the moment in which I was to see my lord marshal, persuaded I should in future find real repose and lasting happiness nowhere but near his person.</p>
<p>On my departure from the island, Kirkeberguer accompanied me to Bienne. I found Wildremet and other Biennois, who, by the water side, waited my getting out of the boat. We all dined together at the inn, and on my arrival there my first care was to provide a chaise, being determined to set off the next morning. Whilst we were at dinner these gentlemen repeated their solicitations to prevail upon me to stay with them, and this with such warmth and obliging protestations, that notwithstanding all my resolutions, my heart, which has never been able to resist friendly attentions, received an impression from theirs; the moment they perceived I was shaken, they redoubled their efforts with so much effect that I was at length overcome, and consented to remain at Bienne, at least until the spring.</p>
<p>Wildremet immediately set about providing me with a lodging, and boasted, as of a fortunate discovery, of a dirty little chamber in the back of the house, on the third story, looking into a courtyard, where I had for a view the display of the stinking skins of a dresser of chamois leather. My host was a man of a mean appearance, and a good deal of a rascal; the next day after I went to his house I heard that he was a debauchee, a gamester, and in bad credit in the neighborhood. He had neither wife, children, nor servants, and shut up in my solitary chamber, I was in the midst of one of the most agreeable countries in Europe, lodged in a manner to make me die of melancholy in the course of a few days. What affected me most was, that, notwithstanding what I had heard of the anxious wish of the inhabitants to receive me amongst them, I had not perceived, as I passed through the streets, anything polite towards me in their manners, or obliging in their looks. I was, however, determined to remain there; but I learned, saw, and felt, the day after, that there was in the city a terrible fermentation, of which I was the cause. Several persons hastened obligingly to inform me that on the next day I was to receive an order conceived in the most severe terms, immediately to quit the state, that is the city. I had nobody in whom I could confide; they who had detained me were dispersed. Wildremet had disappeared; I heard no more of Barthes, and it did not appear that his recommendation had brought me into great favor with those whom he had styled his patrons and fathers. One M. de Van Travers, a Bernois, who had an agreeable house not far from the city, offered it to me for my asylum, hoping, as he said, that I might there avoid being stoned. The advantage this offer held out was not sufficiently flattering to tempt me to prolong my abode with these hospitable people.</p>
<p>Yet, having lost three days by the delay, I had greatly exceeded the twenty-four hours the Bernois had given me to quit their states, and knowing their severity, I was not without apprehensions as to the manner in which they would suffer me to cross them, when the bailiff of Nidau came opportunely and relieved me from my embarrassment. As he had highly disapproved of the violent proceedings of their excellencies, he thought, in his generosity, he owed me some public proof of his taking no part in them, and had courage to leave his bailiwick to come and pay me a visit at Bienne. He did me this favor the evening before my departure, and far from being incognito he affected ceremony, coming in fiocchi in his coach with his secretary, and brought me a passport in his own name that I might cross the state of Berne at my ease, and without fear of molestation. I was more flattered by the visit than by the passport, and should have been as sensible of the merit of it, had it had for object any other person whatsoever. Nothing makes a greater impression on my heart than a well-timed act of courage in favor of the weak unjustly oppressed.</p>
<p>At length, after having with difficulty procured a chaise, I next morning left this barbarous country, before the arrival of the deputation with which I was to be honored, and even before I had seen Theresa, to whom I had written to come to me, when I thought I should remain at Bienne, and whom I had scarcely time to countermand by a short letter, informing her of my new disaster. In the third part of my memoirs, if ever I be able to write them, I shall state in what manner, thinking to set off for Berlin, I really took my departure for England, and the means by which the two ladies who wished to dispose of my person, after having by their manoeuvres driven me from Switzerland, where I was not sufficiently in their power, at last delivered me into the hands of their friend.</p>
<p>I added what follows on reading my memoirs to M. and Madam, the Countess of Egmont, the Prince Pignatelli, the Marchioness of Mesme, and the Marquis of Juigne.</p>
<p>I have written the truth: if any person has heard of things contrary to those I have just stated, were they a thousand times proved, he has heard calumny and falsehood; and if he refuses thoroughly to examine and compare them with me whilst I am alive, he is not a friend either to justice or truth. For my part, I openly, and without the least fear declare, that whoever, even without having read my works, shall have examined with his own eyes, my disposition, character, manners, inclinations, pleasures, and habits, and pronounce me a dishonest man, is himself one who deserves a gibbet.</p>
<p>Thus I concluded, and every person was silent; Madam d’Egmont was the only person who seemed affected; she visibly trembled, but soon recovered herself, and was silent like the rest of the company. Such were the fruits of my reading and declaration.</p>

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm<br/><br/>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of<br/>electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of<br/>computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It<br/>exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations<br/>from people in all walks of life.<br/><br/>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the<br/>assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm’s<br/>goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will<br/>remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project<br/>Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure<br/>and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future<br/>generations.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg<br/>Literary Archive Foundation<br/><br/>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide<br/>spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of<br/>increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be<br/>freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest<br/>array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations<br/>($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt<br/>status with the IRS.<br/><br/>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating<br/>charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United<br/>States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a<br/>considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up<br/>with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations<br/>where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND<br/>DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular<br/>state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate<br/><br/>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we<br/>have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition<br/>against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who<br/>approach us with offers to donate.<br/><br/>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make<br/>any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from<br/>outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.<br/><br/>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation<br/>methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other<br/>ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To<br/>donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate<br/><br/>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.<br/><br/>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project<br/>Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be<br/>freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and<br/>distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of<br/>volunteer support.<br/><br/>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed<br/>editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in<br/>the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not<br/>necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper<br/>edition.<br/><br/>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search<br/>facility: www.gutenberg.org<br/><br/>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,<br/>including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary<br/>Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to<br/>subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.<br/><br/><br/><br/></div>
